# Chaos

A collection of creative, experimental UI components.

## Overview

Chaos is a component library for building unique, animated, and visually striking interfaces. Each component is self-contained and designed to be easily integrated into any web project.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Pamacea/chaos.git

# Or copy individual components you need
```

## Usage

Each component lives in its own directory with all necessary files (HTML, CSS, JS). Import what you need:

```html
<!-- Include the component's CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="components/[component-name]/style.css">

<!-- Include the component's JS (if any) -->
<script src="components/[component-name]/script.js"></script>
```
